Originally I made my website using Wix. There were some problems with this however.
There was an ad for Wix at the top of the page and I had to pay money to use a domain I already owned.
So I have since moved it to Google Sites.
Google Sites however don't let you write HTML or upload an HTML file, instead you need to desing the site using sites.google.com.

So I had to recreate the site by copying individual elements from the site and embedding them in Google Sites.

This has resulted in the site looking slightly different from before I moved it, and if anyone wants to see how it looked back then you can now see it at old.pieweb.site.
